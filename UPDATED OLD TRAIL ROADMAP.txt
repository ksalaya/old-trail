UPDATED OLD TRAIL ROADMAP


OLD TRAIL – MASTER ROADMAP (SANDBOX SURVIVAL EDITION)
0. Vision & Pillars
Goal: Old Trail is a sandbox survival sim in the Oregon Trail setting (1840s–1860s): part historical travelogue, part The Long Dark / UnReal World–style survival roguelike. You’re guiding a wagon party west (or living as one of them), juggling weather, illness, scarcity, and route decisions on an hourly timescale.
Core pillars:
1. Historically grounded simulation
Route segments, forts, climate, hazards and prices follow documented Oregon Trail geography and diaries – from the Great Plains “ocean of grass” to the harsh passes and cholera corridor along the Platte.
2. Modern survival depth
Condition, hunger, thirst, warmth, fatigue, and morale behave more like The Long Dark / UnReal World – attrition over weeks, not just instant “health points”, with diet quality, weather exposure, and equipment all feeding long-term risk.
3. Dynamic, semi-open journey
The trail is a directed graph of segments and cutoffs (Sublette vs. Fort Bridger, Three Island vs. south of Snake, Columbia vs. Barlow), each with its own climate, hazards, and events.
4. Living painting viewport
The main scene feels like traveling inside a Bierstadt/Remington/Maggiori painting – luminous skies, storm drama, and small wagons against epic landscapes – with mood and weather-aware scene selection.
5. HTML5-first, embeddable & performant
Single-file or light-asset HTML5 that runs well when embedded (Weebly/iframe), with careful use of canvas, audio, and overlays to avoid slowing the host page.

1. Foundations (Status – Already Implemented)
These are present in after_first-update.txt and don’t need to reappear as “TODOs”:
   * Modern UI shell & HUD
   * Start screen with leader, background, departure info.
   * Travel/Camp screen with survival bars (condition, warmth, energy, etc.), trail status HUD, log window, map strip with current-mile indicator, supplies overview, and responsive layout.
   * Time & mode
   * Hourly simulation with morning / noon / evening / night blocks, travel vs. camp mode toggle, and nightly guard/ travel tracking tied into a daily rhythm object and “proper vs. rushed camp” macros.
   * Party, stats & tasks baseline
   * Party manifest, skills, simple use-based progression hooks.
   * Core survival stats per person (hunger, thirst, energy, warmth, morale).
   * Job delegation system with priorities (RimWorld-style), “auto” vs. manual tasks, and essential-jobs auto assignment (travel, cooking, water, repair, guard).
   * Trail structure & scenes v1
   * Route represented as mile-based segments and major landmarks (Independence → Fort Kearny → Fort Laramie → South Pass → Fort Hall → Blue Mountains → The Dalles → Oregon City).
   * SCENE_BANDS mapping mileage bands to mood-tagged background images (clear / heat / storm / cold).
   * Weather system v1
   * Seeded, region-aware hourly weather (getWeather) with Perlin noise, climate baselines per region, altitude-based lapse rate, and snowline logic.
   * Start-date profiles that bias risk toward swollen rivers (early) vs. heat and storms (late).
   * Save/load & local persistence
   * Game state serialization, log rehydration, and reset.
Everything below assumes this foundation exists and focuses on expanding it into a full Oregon Trail survival sandbox.

2. Milestone 1 – Survival & Diet Overhaul (Next Major Feature Block)
Theme: Make daily survival decisions as deep and interesting as route choices. Eating, resting, and camp setup should feel like UnReal World / The Long Dark–style planning, not a single “food” bar.
2.1. Deeper cooking & meal system (Roadmap C)
   * Recipe-based cooking tasks
   * Implement historically grounded recipes: mush & bacon, flapjacks & coffee, beans & bacon, trail stew, special salmon pot at Salmon Falls, etc.
   * Each recipe:
   * Inputs: exact supplies (flour vs cornmeal, beans, bacon, fresh meat, dried fruit, coffee, fuel).
   * Time cost (quick fry-up 1h vs proper supper 2–3h).
   * Skill hooks (Cooking skill changes burn chance, yield quality, flavor text).
   * Ration tier → recipe availability
   * On filling rations, cook tasks can choose hearty or feast recipes if supplies allow.
   * On meager / bare-bones, auto-degrade to quick fry-ups or even burnt/boring meals with log flavor.
   * Food group tracking & long-term health
   * Track 10–14 day rolling intake across Staples, Meat/Fat, Fruit/Veg, Coffee/Tea. Missing groups accumulate risk of fatigue, poor recovery, and scurvy-style afflictions (“camp fever”).
   * Camp effort macros
   * Make existing “Proper Camp / Rushed Camp” macros drive meal types:
   * Rushed: mostly quick fry-ups, little warmth/morale gain.
   * Proper: unlocks hearty stews and feasts, bigger warmth/morale boosts but more fuel and time. Wet fuel or low cooking skill increases burn risk and waste, with diary-inspired flavor text.
   * Region-aware recipes
   * Tie special recipes to segments: buffalo-rich stews on the Platte, salmon & roots in Snake/Columbia, vegetable-heavy meals near Grande Ronde/Whitman/Boi­se.
2.2. Spoilage & preservation
   * Climate-based spoilage
   * Use region & weather to set decay rates: fast spoilage in hot, dry Snake/alkali, slower in cool high passes & Blue Mountains forests.
   * Preservation actions
   * New camp jobs: smoke/dry meat, salt meat, cache perishables in cool streams or dugouts to slow decay, drawing on historical practices and survival-game best practices.
2.3. Condition & fatigue tuning
   * Make hunger, thirst, warmth and sleep interact more strongly with movement speed, error risk, and illness chance, tuning numbers toward long-run attrition like modern survival sims rather than “instant death” spikes.

3. Milestone 2 – Routes, Cutoffs & Weather Layer 2.0
Theme: Route choices and departure timing become big, replay-defining decisions.
3.1. Route cards & fork decisions (Roadmap A)
   * Route card UI at each fork
   * For Sublette vs Fort Bridger, Fort Hall vs Salt Lake Cutoff, Three Island vs lower Snake, Columbia raft vs Barlow; show:
   * Extra miles vs baseline.
   * Expected days from fork to next major fort at steady pace.
   * Climate modifiers (+heat, -water vs +cool nights, +grass).
   * Special events unlocked (Shoshone trade at Bridger, alkali basin events on Sublette, etc.).
   * Historical hint text
   * Diary snippets in log when choosing routes – advisory tone but not prescriptive (“Men talk of the ‘dry drive’ ahead…”).
   * Route stress memory
   * Track a hidden “route stress” score per major leg to feed into oxen fatigue and morale events (“No one wants another dry basin like the one behind us”).
3.2. Weather 2.0 tied to segments (on top of existing weather system)
   * Segment-specific climate tuning
   * Extend CLIMATE baselines so each named segment (Kansas bottomlands, Platte, Sweetwater, Snake plain, Blues, Columbia) has tuned pRain/pStorm/temp bands based on the historical guide.
   * Disease-linked weather windows
   * In the Platte “cholera corridor,” unusually wet+warm weeks sharply increase bad-water and cholera/dysentery events when drinking from stagnant holes or marshes.
   * Snow window logic in passes
   * At South Pass, Blues, Barlow: late travel (vs historical “normal window”) triggers frost/snow events, mud and blizzard penalties, potentially trapped-wagon events if very late.
   * Oxen/weather interplay
   * Introduce a “stock strain” score per day combining heat, grade, mud, and headwind vs. good grass and cool days; feed into pulling capacity, breakdown chance, and death events.

4. Milestone 3 – Health, Illness & Medical Play
Theme: Geography-anchored illnesses and injuries that unfold over days, not single die rolls.
4.1. Afflictions and progression (Roadmap H)
   * Region-aware risk tables
   * Platte (warm, wet): high cholera/dysentery risk on bad water; Snake alkali country: alkali water events that hurt condition and morale unless diluted or avoided; South Pass/Blues/Barlow: frostbite risk at night if warmth & clothing too low.
   * Multi-stage illnesses
   * Each major illness (dysentery, cholera, scurvy, mountain fever, pneumonia, camp fever, snakebite, broken bones, exhaustion) has stages: risk → onset → crisis→ recovery/death, with clear log feedback, treatment windows, and debuffs.
   * Treatments & supplies
   * Use doctoring tasks plus supplies (rest, boiled water, herbal remedies, bandages, opiates, etc.) to influence outcomes. Missing treatment or misdiagnosis makes things worse.
4.2. Doctoring gameplay
   * Doctoring skill & diagnosis
   * Skill affects diagnosis clarity (“likely cholera vs. simple stomach upset”), treatment effectiveness, and resource efficiency.
   * Forts & specialized care
   * At forts, pay steep prices or accept story consequences for better treatment (e.g., experimental medicine, quarantine, time lost).
   * Injury events
   * Boating accidents, wagon rollovers, gun mishaps, and animal incidents that create long-term injuries influencing travel speed and task performance.

5. Milestone 4 – Companion Schedules, Camp Tasks & Crafting
Theme: Camp life becomes a deep sandbox: you run a small RimWorld-style party on wheels.
5.1. Task delegation depth
   * Job list expansion
   * Beyond travel/cook/fetch water/guard/repair, add jobs like:
   * Hunt/game processing, foraging, woodcutting, herbalism, smoking/salting meat, ammo crafting, gear repair, cartography/journal, animal handling.
   * Schedule grid (per person)
   * Optional 24h schedule like RimWorld: define blocks (Travel, Camp chores, Rest, Guard, Free) which bias the delegation system hour by hour.
   * Task hints from daily rhythm
   * Use day-block context to nudge tasks (morning travel bonus, noon micro-events like school/church, evening camp macros auto-assign combos of wood/water/guard/cooking).
5.2. Crafting & camp UI
   * Camp Tasks Menu UI
   * Bring in the camp-tasks-menu visual design as a dedicated panel for chores & crafting queues (wood, water, repair, craft, preserve, doctoring), showing time costs and required tools.
   * Crafting system
   * Implement a simple recipe UI: list craftable items (smoked meat, repaired shoes, patched wagon cover, extra ammunition, herbal tonic) with inputs, tools, and time. Allow canceling with partial losses, following survival-game craft UX recommendations.
   * NPC autonomy
   * Companions on “auto” should pick chores based on priorities, stats (e.g. don’t assign the exhausted person to night guard), and immediate needs (low water, broken wagon, looming weather).

6. Milestone 5 – Forts, Trading & Economy
Theme: Forts and trading posts become big strategic beats, not just “shops”.
6.1. Fort-specific prices & stocks (Roadmap F)
   * Price tables
   * Implement realistic price curves:
   * Independence/St. Joseph: baseline Missouri prices.
   * Fort Kearny/Laramie: 2–3× multipliers on staples.
   * Fort Hall/Boise: 4–10× multipliers on flour, bacon, sugar, coffee.
   * Stock logic
   * Some forts intentionally under-stock certain goods (e.g., early Fort Hall), generating scarcity and tough decisions.
   * Trade goods that matter
   * Introduce compact, high-value goods: warm blankets, coffee, sugar, tobacco, spare ammunition, bright cloth – used in both fort shops and encounters with Native groups for food, guidance, or safe passage.
6.2. Store & ledger UI
   * General Store Ledger interface
   * Use the GENERAL STORE LEDGER widget design as the template:
   * Left: categories & items with descriptions; Right: ledger showing current cash, weight, and pending purchases.
   * Clear feedback on wagon capacity (safe 1,600–2,000 lb window with overload messaging tied to real wagon capacities).
   * Fort / Trading Post screen
   * Dedicated fort view with:
   * Local scene art & mood.
   * Store ledger.
   * Optional side interactions: gossip, doctor, blacksmith, optional side missions.
   * Barter encounters
   * Simple barter screen using the ledger UI for ad hoc trading with travelers or Native groups (trading blankets / ammunition for food or route guidance).

7. Milestone 6 – Dynamic Trail Encounters & Sandbox Events
Theme: The trail feels alive and unpredictable like a Red Dead–style frontier, but tuned to a finite westward journey.
7.1. Encounter system
   * Ambient dynamic events
   * Per hour of travel or camp, roll for location/biome/weather/time-dependent events:
   * Ambushes and bandit attacks in passes or wooded ravines.
   * Travelers in distress (decisions: help & share supplies, recruit, ignore).
   * Buffalo herds, antelope, or scarce game opportunities depending on segment.
   * Weather-caused hazards (flash floods, lightning striking a nearby tree, dust storms, etc.).
   * Multi-outcome decisions
   * Each event offers multiple responses (flee/fight/negotiate, ford/wait/build ferry, detour vs. press on) feeding into survival stats, supplies, reputation/morale.
7.2. Reputation & story threads (later in this milestone or next)
   * Simple reputation flags (merciful, ruthless, shrewd trader, generous) that:
   * Influence prices, help offered by NPCs, ambush frequency.
   * Drive unique late-game events at The Dalles/Oregon City.

8. Milestone 7 – Scene System, Art Direction & Overlays
Theme: Tie all the painterly research into a living “time window” viewport.
8.1. Mood-based scene picker (Roadmap G)
   * Scene tagging
   * Tag each scene with attributes like travel_day_clear, camp_evening_rain, night_guard, feast_event, illness_camp.
   * Selection logic
   * Picker uses:
   * Region & miles (scene bands already in code).
   * Mode (camp vs travel).
   * Weather (clear/heat/storm/cold).
   * Party mood (morale, illness, recent feast/tragedy).
   * Event scenes
   * Temporary overlay scenes for big moments (river crossing, crash, illness crisis, major trade), fading back to ambient travel/camp scenes.
8.2. Art style hooks
   * Bierstadt / Remington / Maggiori palettes
   * Region/mood presets:
   * Bierstadt-style luminous dawn/sunset for triumphant milestones (South Pass, Grande Ronde, Oregon City).
   * Remington nocturnes for tense camps and raids (blue-green nights, warm fire cores, strong silhouettes).
   * Maggiori-style storm drama and dust-haze sunsets for heat waves and dust storms.
   * Overlay stack & audio (Roadmap I)
   * Optional rain/snow/lighting overlays synchronized to weather and log entries.
   * Web Audio ambient loops (prairie wind, storms, campfire, fort bustle) and UI click/tension stingers.
   * Fullscreen & mobile polish
   * Temporal Viewport fullscreen button, mobile touch-friendly targets, and optional “suggest fullscreen” on Begin Journey when embedded.

9. Milestone 8 – Skills, Background Perks & Meta-Progression
Theme: Builds long-term replayability and that “one more run west” feeling.
9.1. Skill progression (Roadmap E)
   * Use-based skills
   * Travel, Hunting, Cooking, Woodcutting, Doctoring, future Riverwork – gain XP by doing; each has thresholds unlocking micro-perks.
   * Soft per-day XP caps
   * Prevent grinding a single task in one day to max level, UnReal World–style.
   * Background-linked perks
   * Each leader background unlocks perk choices at mid/high skill:
   * Farmer: better oxen handling & grass sense.
   * Banker: better trade rates and occasional credit/loan events.
   * Carpenter: improved wagon repairs, less part usage.
   * Teacher: morale boosts from stories/schooling, better doctoring outcomes.
   * Skill-synergy checks
   * Combine skills in checks (Travel + Woodcutting for steep descent, Hunting + Stealth for tricky game).
9.2. Meta & scenarios
   * Permadeath runs with diary carryover
   * Each failed or successful run generates a short “journal page” summary and maybe unlocks:
   * New backgrounds (e.g., experienced guide, mountain man).
   * Alternative starts (St. Joseph vs Independence).
   * Challenge modes (hard winter year, disease-heavy year).
   * Alternate scenarios
   * California-bound variant (post–Fort Hall branch).
   * Late-season emergency trek with less prep time.
   * Solo trapper or mail express mode (minimal party, high risk).

10. Milestone 9 – Tech, Embedding & Tools
Theme: Make Old Trail easy to ship, embed, and iterate with AI tools and Git.
   * Single-embed HTML5 bundle
   * Keep the game as a single <div> + <style> + <script> for Weebly/custom-HTML embedding, or an externally hosted bundle for iframe embedding following the Codex/HTML5 best-practices doc.
   * Performance safeguards
   * Pause simulation when the tab or iframe is not visible.
   * Defer heavy audio/image loads until first interaction.
   * AI-assisted workflows
   * Maintain clear prompts and file comments so Codex / GPT can safely refactor UI modules, add new scenes, or tweak systems without breaking the single-file embed constraints.
