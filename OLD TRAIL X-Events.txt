OLD TRAIL X-Events
Core Approach (so it stays replayable, not just “random spooky”)
1) Run Seed: “Case File” (pick 1–2 per journey)
Each run secretly picks a theme that boosts certain event pools and makes the trail feel like an alternate version of itself.
* CASE FILE: SKY NOTES (lights, crashes, star-metal, abductions)
* CASE FILE: BODY MARKS (bites, infections, mutations, “operations”)
* CASE FILE: TIME SLIPS (missing hours, doubles, déjà vu, swapped landmarks)
* CASE FILE: FORT CONSPIRACY (clerks, ledgers, quarantines, cover-ups)
* CASE FILE: WOOD & HOLLOW (cults, hidden valleys, “people not right”)
* CASE FILE: WATER THAT TALKS (rivers, drown-whispers, fish with eyes)
* CASE FILE: THE LOST COMPANY (another wagon train you keep almost meeting)
2) Add Two Lightweight Run Variables
These make outcomes “stick” like RimWorld.
* Strangeness (0–100): starts low; rises from anomalies, fever, forbidden items. Higher = weirder events, worse paranoia, bigger rewards.
* Heat (0–100): how “noticed” you are (by forts, cults, watchers). Higher = ambushes, interrogations, forced quarantine.
3) Persistent “Marks” on Pawns
Instead of one-off events, give pawns conditions that evolve:
* Strange Bite / Star Burn / Night Surgery / Hollow Cough / Dream-Latched
Each has stages (mild → severe → transformation / cure / death / “new ability”).

Event Chains (12 long-form “X-Files episodes”)
Each chain is 4–7 nodes that can branch and reappear later. You can sprinkle nodes across weeks so it feels like a mystery.
CHAIN A — “The Fallen Star”
   1. Green Fire Over the Ridge (Uncommon, Night)
A silent arc of green light.
      * Investigate: +Strangeness, chance to gain Star-Iron Shard

Quick “Combinatoric” Event Generator (so you can make infinite)
If you want effectively endless variety, combine:
[ODD SIGN] + [PRACTICAL PROBLEM] + [CHOICE] + [LASTING MARK]
                                                                           * Odd Sign: lights, knocking cough, wrong shadow, humming fog, warm stone
                                                                           * Practical Problem: low food, broken axle, river crossing, illness, fort prices
                                                                           * Choice: investigate / ignore / trade / burn / quarantine / steal away
                                                                           * Lasting Mark: new trait, new condition, new Heat/Strangeness modifier, new enemy/faction attention

If you want, I can also convert all of this into a clean JSON-like event pack (titles, triggers, weights, option arrays, condition stages) that you can paste into a Codex prompt so it plugs into your current random-event system with minimal risk.
