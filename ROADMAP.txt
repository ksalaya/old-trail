Old Trail – Consolidated Roadmap
================================

Travel & Explorer View
----------------------
- Route & cutoff strategy cards (Sublette vs. Fort Bridger, Snake crossings, Columbia rafting vs. Barlow) with distance/climate tradeoffs and diary flavor when chosen.
- Weather layer 2.0 tied to route segments and start-date tuning: segment-specific climate/risk tables, high-river and late-snow windows, river depth informed by recent precipitation, and clearer schedule hints at major forts.
- Explorer follow-ups: expand the tile world to the full route with historical landmarks, sync tiles more tightly to mileage/waypoints, add sprite-based wagons/companions with animation and weather overlays, tie encounters to map features (hunting grounds, crossings, passes), add mobile/touch controls, and polish transitions/effects for the explorer viewport.

Camp & Delegation
-----------------
- Per-companion chore assignment with visible timing, guard/night watch layering, and weather-aware mishaps (flooded stores, wind damage, storm layovers).
- Deeper crafting/camp systems: regional recipes and spoilage tracking, skill-based outcomes and partial successes, crafting recipes with inputs/outputs (ammo, wagon repairs, smoked meat, herbal tonics), and clearer overload feedback.
- Meal authenticity pass: historical menu roster (mush & bacon, beans & bacon, salmon pots, flapjacks), ration-tier gating for recipes, rolling food-group tracker (staples/meat/fruit-veg/coffee), and effort-based meal macros (quick fry-ups vs. proper suppers) influenced by fuel/skill.

Storyteller & Events
--------------------
- Storyteller preset polish (cards, tooltips, mid-run toggle UX), tension curve tuning, and richer cascade analytics on the end screen.
- Broaden romance/feud/relationship arcs with multi-step beats, mental break consequences, and event choices that react to camp tasks and delegation.
- Expand the event library for river dramas, illness cascades, weather/route-specific hazards (prairie fire, blizzards, dust storms), and add clinic/mission interactions at forts.

Illness & Medical
-----------------
- Additional diseases and stages: cholera, scurvy, mountain pneumonia, snakebite, broken bones, with clearer onset/crisis/recovery beats and affliction overlays when crises hit.
- Water quality system with boiled/filtered choices, campsite water consequences, and explicit doctoring tasks or fort clinics that trade time/money for recovery odds.
- Risk tuning from geography and weather: cholera corridor along the Platte, alkali poisoning in desert basins, frostbite/hypothermia in high passes, and dehydration or dust illness during hot/dry stretches.

UI Polish & Accessibility
-------------------------
- Temporal viewport polish: optional fullscreen toggle, CRT/overlay stack, rain/snow/lightning effects tied to events, and painterly palettes that echo region/weather mood.
- Mobile-friendly interaction: larger touch targets, explorer touch/virtual d-pad controls, and considerate fullscreen prompts on mobile start.

Art & Audio
-----------
- Painterly parallax layers for travel/camp scenes across biomes, with wagon/oxen/companion sprites in explorer and tactical scenes.
- Ambient soundscape (wind, storms, campfire, forts) plus lightweight UI/audio sprites for clicks, events, and camp tasks.

Technical & Data
----------------
- Externalize trail geometry/world chunks for explorer (supports cutoffs and alternate routes) and add tactical mini-maps for raids/rescues/crossings that hook into delegation.
- Persist/visualize fog-of-war progress and explorer positions alongside storyteller timelines for post-run summaries.

Already Implemented / Notes
---------------------------
- Hourly simulation, delegation, nutrition tracking, and daily rhythm blocks are live; future items above extend those systems.
- Explorer world camera now advances real time and shares the survival HUD/log widgets; future items cover content and polish expansions.

Illness & Medical – future work
-------------------------------
- Expand contagion modeling so camp fever and cholera spread between companions instead of isolated rolls (AFFLICTION_DEFS, maybeTriggerIllnessForHour).
- Add richer treatment options and medicine crafting to support the doctor job (performDoctoring, SUPPLY_ITEMS, AFFLICTION_DEFS).
- Wire more granular water planning UI (boil vs. filter vs. raw) directly into water risk weighting and storyteller events.
- Extend fort/mission care into interactive choice events with costs, time delays, and partial recoveries (EVENT_DEFS fort_hospital_care).
- Add visual affordances for improving/declining afflictions in the alerts strip (renderAfflictionAlerts) and companion detail.

Camp & Chores – follow-ups
--------------------------
- Manual per-hour chore editing with drag/drop or arrow controls layered on top of the generated camp plan (ot-camp-overlay, campPlan timeline).
- Let the camp planner preview different camp macro lengths (proper vs. rushed vs. extended) before committing to time advancement.

Spoilage & Recipes – follow-ups
-------------------------------
- Finer-grained spoilage that tracks batches by harvest/cook time and preservation method, with UI hints when supplies turn.
- More regional recipes, preservation (smoking/drying) steps, and meal quality tiers tied to skill outcomes and risk events.

Thought Library & Narrative – follow-ups
---------------------------------------
- Add larger pools of mood/region/weather-aware thoughts, including social/relationship-aware arcs and recurring lines with callbacks to past events.

Audio & Polish – follow-ups
---------------------------
- More sound cues (guard scares, illness events, crafting failure), volume sliders, and accessibility toggles to reduce animations/screen shake for sensitive players.
