=== Illness & Medical – TODO / FUTURE HOOKS ===
- Add additional diseases: cholera (more lethal than dysentery), scurvy/camp-scurvy tied directly to long-term low fruitVeg intake, mountain pneumonia in high passes, snakebite, broken bones, etc.
- Integrate water quality tracking (safe wells/boiled vs. stagnant/alkali sources) and make bad-water choices explicitly increase dysentery/cholera risk.
- Replace the current “automatic doctoring” with an explicit Doctor task:
  - Add a 'Doctor / Care for sick' task in the hour-tasks UI.
  - Wire JOB_DEFS.doctor to a distinct task id and handle it in performTask().
- Add affliction icons/overlays in the temporal viewport when a major crisis occurs.
- Tie afflictions more strongly into events:
  - Hospital/mission care at forts (expensive but higher survival).
  - Quarantine or delay events when an epidemic sweeps through the camp.
- Refine numbers and probabilities using historical cholera-corridor research and playtesting.


CAMP & CRAFTING – FUTURE TODO
- Per-companion chore assignment with visible roles and timing.
- Skill-based camp and crafting results plus richer failure/partial success states.
- Weather-aware camp events (flooded camp, blown tents) and deeper guard/night watch effects.
- Expanded regional recipes and preservation methods, plus spoilage tracking.
- Larger thought library with location- and event-aware lines and cooldowns.
- Audio/animation polish for campfire, crafting ticks, and trail log entries.
