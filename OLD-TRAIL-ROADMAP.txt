OLD-TRAIL-ROADMAP (canonical)

VISION PILLARS
- Darkly humorous survival sim rooted in historical Oregon Trail grit and hard tradeoffs.
- Dream-West layer: X-files-on-the-frontier omens and curios that stay opt-in when mythic is off.
- Replayable runs via storyteller presets, route forks, faction reputations, and seeded events.
- Embeddable, performant single-file HTML that feels like a living painting viewport.

CURRENT FOUNDATION (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)
- Single-file Weebly-ready HTML with start flow, save/load, and persistence for logs, stories, and inventories.
- Storyteller presets (Calm, Classic, Chaotic, Harsh) that drive tension curves and pacing gates.
- Hourly simulation with morning/noon/evening/night blocks, travel vs camp macros, guard/camp quality checks, and scene picker.
- Party stats, afflictions, mythic toggles, curios, faction reputation tracking, and trade ledgers.
- Trail log, journal beats, encounter modal system, and B-seed Dream-West hooks already driving events (Open Eye, Men in Gray, mirror wagon, tariffs, peddlers, etc.).

NEXT 3 PASSES
1) Dream-West polish & pacing guardrails (short cycle)
   - Add one-time callbacks for any remaining flagged seeds; enforce >=36h global B-seed spacing and respect mythic toggle.
   - Add concise debug/UX affordance to show when a seed is cooling down or disabled by mode/block.
   - Acceptance: callbacks fire once, log once, and save/load safely without mythic bleed-through.
2) Route cards & travel forecasting
   - Present fork-specific route cards (Sublette vs. Bridger, Three Island vs. south Snake, Columbia raft vs. Barlow) with miles, climate bias, and resupply hints.
   - Journal/log diary lines when a route is chosen; include “you are early/late” schedule nudges at Laramie, South Pass, The Dalles.
   - Acceptance: cards display correct deltas, schedule hints match date bands, and paths update trail/POI data without map errors.
3) Survival meals & condition tuning (scoped first slice)
   - Introduce a handful of authentic recipes (mush & bacon, beans & bacon, trail stew) tied to fuel/time and ration tier.
   - Track simple food group intake (staples/meat/fruit-veg/coffee) for rolling 10–14 day penalties and small morale/condition nudges.
   - Acceptance: recipes consume correct supplies, cook tasks respect camp quality, and malnourishment warnings surface without overwhelming the log.

BACKLOG / DEFERRED
Events & Storyteller
- Expand B-seed roster with regional omens, river variants, and mythic-safety fallbacks; add rare storyteller-specific beats.
- Add late-run event overlays (river cliff scenes, wagon crash, illness crisis) tied to scene picker tags.
Factions & Trade
- Fort-specific price/stock tables (Independence baseline; Kearny/Laramie x2–3; Hall/Boise 4–10x) with tariff/policy flavor.
- Barter/ledger polish: clearer capacity feedback (1,600–2,000 lb safe window) and recurring vendor restock behaviors per fort.
- Add high-value trade goods (blankets, coffee, sugar, tobacco, ammo) that matter in faction encounters.
Survival & Health
- Weather 2.0 per segment: rain/storm/heat/snow tuned to Kansas bottomlands, Platte cholera corridor, South Pass/Blues/Barlow snow windows.
- Stock strain/oxen fatigue score blending heat, grade, mud, and headwind; feeds breakdown and pace penalties.
- Multi-stage illnesses (dysentery/cholera/alkali/frostbite/pneumonia/exhaustion) with diagnosis/treatment hooks and doctoring skill influence.
Social / Pawns
- Schedule grid for delegation (travel/camp/rest/guard) with auto-assignment tweaks and trait-aware job picks.
- Camp crafting jobs (smoke/salt meat, patch gear, craft ammo/herbal tonics) with time/tool costs and cancel/partial-loss handling.
UI / Polish
- Fullscreen toggle and mobile touch spacing; maintain single-file footprint.
- Explorer/map strip polish with painterly terrain tiles, fog/weather overlays, and responsive controls.
- Log clarity: tag filter for events/trade/journal and reduced spam from repeated micro actions.
Audio / Art
- Ambient audio loops (prairie wind, storms, river crossings, night campfire, fort bustle) with lightweight Web Audio sprite system.
- Optional lightning/rain/snow overlay tied to weather events; Bierstadt/Remington/Maggiori-inspired mood palettes per region and block.

UPDATED VISION — DREAM-WEST CORE
- Mythic-only Dream-West baseline: tall tales, omens, and X-files-on-the-frontier weirdness always simmering beneath the grit.
- Dark humor and replayable runs anchored by storyteller pacing, with tension swings and strange curiosities as expected texture.
- Single-file, save-friendly delivery that keeps choices legible even as the world drifts uncanny.

DONE (THIS PASS)
- Mythic encounters always on; toggle removed and saves migrated.
- Narrator UI polish: card detail layout fixed and dropdown duplication hidden.
- Skills scaled to 1–20 with tiered formulas, XP tuning, and migration.
- Party generation refreshed with expanded names, varied trait counts/mix, age-aware skills, and better randomness.
- Trait hover tooltips added across draft and in-run views.

NEXT / DEFERRED
- Rapid-fire seed events pack (B-set filler beats) with hard cooldowns.
- Tier B big setpieces (B-01..B-05 etc.).
- Remaining chain followups: EX-01..EX-10, H-01/H-02/H-04/H-05/H-07, S-01/S-05/S-06/S-08, mythic M-01/M-02/M-05/M-08.
- Deeper faction politics arcs (rival forts, Open Eye Revival cult, Men in Gray full arc).
- Wire Open Eye / Men in Gray rep into trade modifiers + UI surfacing.
- Fill remaining Dream-West B-set seeds/callbacks with region variants and tuned tension.
- Extend Open Eye into later-tier confrontations/aid (escort/delivery) once chains support it.
- Full mental-break/meltdown loop tied to morale/stress (multi-state, escalating).
- Deeper multi-step mythic questlines across regions/days with callbacks.
- Recurring NPC caravans/factions over time (return visits, remembered favors/grudges).
- Event overlap/queue rules to avoid conflicting incidents in same block.
- Expanded storyteller roster/weirdness slider UI + pacing rules.
- Broader social arc varieties (long rivalries/romance/campfire followups) with trait-driven hooks.

Deferred after B-Set Filler + B-01 Setpiece pass
- Build remaining Tier B setpieces (B-02..B-05) with follow-up callbacks and matching 10-day cooldown pacing.
- Add further Dream-West B-set filler beats and regional variants, including follow-ups for flags like seed_b16_mailbag_kept and seed_b19_mirror_mark.
