OLD-TRAIL-ROADMAP*
A. Routes & Cutoffs → Big Strategic Choices
Existing goals (kept):
* Sublette vs. Fort Bridger, Three Island vs. south of Snake, Columbia rafting vs. Barlow Road.
* Each route changes distance, hazards, events, and forts. 
* “You are early/late” hints at Fort Laramie, South Pass, The Dalles based on real schedule targets. 
New detail & extensions:
1. Segment-level route cards
   * For each fork, define a “route card” with:
      * Extra miles vs. baseline.
      * Expected total days from fork to next major fort at steady pace.
      * Climate tweak (e.g., Sublette: +heat, +dust, -water; Bridger: +cool nights, +grass, +resupply). 
      * Special events unlocked (Shoshone trade near Bridger, alkali/dry basin events on Sublette, etc.).
2. Historical route hints & diary flavor
   * Add log snippets based on diaries when a route is chosen:
      * “Men talk of the ‘dry drive’ ahead; we must fill every cask at Green River.” (Sublette) 
      * “Some say Bridger’s road is longer, but with better grass and a friendly fort for repairs.” (Fort Bridger path).
   * Use these as soft recommendations, not hard tutorials.
3. Route difficulty memory
   * Track a hidden “route stress” score for each major segment:
      * Long desert legs, bad water, and steep passes increase stress.
      * Good grass, cool weather, and successful trades decrease it.
   * This can later feed into:
      * Oxen fatigue & failure risk.
      * Companion morale (“Everyone dreads another dry basin like the one behind us.”).
B. Weather Layer 2.0 Tied to Route Segments
Existing goals (kept):
* Early departures → high rivers and more storms; late → dust and heat on Platte/Snake/alkali.
* Cholera corridor along Platte in wet years; late snow in South Pass / Blues / Barlow. 
New detail & extensions:
1. Segment-specific climate tuning
   * Use per-segment profiles (Kansas bottomlands, Platte, Sweetwater, Snake plain, Blues, Columbia) with:
      * Seasonally adjusted pRain, pStorm, and temperature bands tuned to notes from the routes + daily life PDFs.
2. Disease-linked weather windows
   * Along the Platte, if a week is unusually wet + warm:
      * Increase bad-water event chance and cholera/dysentery risk when drinking from riverbank “holes” or marshes. 
3. Snow window logic
   * At South Pass, Blues, and Barlow:
      * Check date vs. “normal window” (from routes PDF). If late, add light snow/frost event chance and travel penalties, escalating into blizzard events if very late. 
4. Oxen/weather interplay
   * Add a per-day “stock strain” score:
      * Long hot days, bad mud, steep grades, and headwinds increase it.
      * Cool clear days and good camp (proper evening camp macro) reduce it. 
C. Deeper Cooking & Meal Types, Historically Grounded
(This is the next big feature when you say “let’s restart.”)
Existing goals (kept):
* Named menu: mush & bacon, beans & bacon supper, buffalo/antelope stews, salmon stews at Salmon Falls, etc.
* Food “groups” (staples, meat, fruit/veg, coffee/tea) and long-term diet penalties.
* Camp effort vs. meal quality; fuel and skill affecting yields and burn chance.
New detail & extensions (from food PDF + daily life):
1. Authentic meal roster
 Use historically documented staples and routines:
   * Breakfast archetypes
   * Mush & bacon: flour/cornmeal + water + a little bacon grease.
   * Flapjacks & coffee: flour + saleratus + water/coffee + bacon grease.
   * Supper archetypes
   * Beans & bacon: beans_rice + bacon + 2h simmer + decent fuel.
   * Trail stew: fresh_meat + flour (dumplings) + dried_fruit or roots (when available).
   * Salmon pot at Salmon Falls: special recipe unlocked via trade events.
   2. Ration tier → recipe availability
   * On filling rations, cook tasks can choose from hearty/feast recipes if supplies allow.
   * On meager/bare-bones, cooking often devolves to quick fry-ups (simple meals or even burnt bread & coffee flavor events).
   3. Food group tracker
   * Maintain a rolling 10–14 day window of intake for:
   * Staples (flour/hardtack/cornmeal/beans).
   * Meat/fat (bacon, fresh_meat, rich stews).
   * Fruit/veg (dried fruit, traded vegetables, foraged berries).
   * Coffee/tea (morale stimulant). 
   * Missing groups → slowly accumulate risks:
   * Low fruit/veg → scurvy-like events (bleeding gums, poor healing).
   * Low meat/fat → chronic fatigue and slower condition recovery.
   * No coffee/tea for “coffee people” → morale malus.
   4. Meal effort macros
   * Quick fry-up (1h):
   * Low fuel cost, can run in poor weather.
   * Often yields meal_simple and uses basic staples.
   * Proper supper (2–3h):
   * Requires decent fuel and often a “camp quality” macro (Proper Camp).
   * Converts more raw pounds → hearty/feast meals with better morale and warmth.
   * Wet fuel / low skill → higher burn rates, with flavor text pulled from diaries (“biscuits burnt on the bottom, doughy on top”).
   5. Region-aware recipes
   * Tie certain recipes to segments:
   * Buffalo-heavy feasts in Platte/buffalo country.
   * Salmon & roots in Snake/Columbia.
   * Potatoes and vegetables more common near Grande Ronde/Whitman Mission/Boise.
D. Daily Rhythm & Event Layer (implemented v1, future tweaks)
Already implemented:
   * Morning/noon/evening/night blocks, daily rhythm scoring, camp macros (proper vs rushed), and night watch risk.
Future depth layers:
   1. Task nudges by block
   * Morning: subtle boosts to travel speed + oxen recovery when you respect traditional 3–5h morning marches. 
   * Noon: special micro-events (minor wagon fixes, brief doctoring, school or Sunday service on select days).
   * Evening: replace some manual micro with bundled macros (camp quality already in place; later, we can auto-assign wood/water/guard/cooking combos based on priorities).
   2. Historical day types
   * Mark special days with unique log copy and slight rhythm expectations:
   * Sunday “layover” days (rest & worship if morale is low or doctoring is needed).
   * Forced layover days (storms, blizzards, or high water—heavy impact on upcoming schedule hints).
E. Future Skill Progression Hooks
Existing goals (kept):
   * Use-based skills for Travel, Hunting, Cooking, Woodcutting, Doctoring, plus future Riverwork.
   * Micro-perks at skill thresholds (Cooking 3, Woodcutting 4, Riverwork 3, etc.).
New additions:
   1. Soft per-day XP caps
   * Borrow UnReal World–style daily caps so players can’t grind one task in a single day to max it. 
   2. Background-linked perk trees
   * Each background (Farmer/Banker/Carpenter/Teacher) unlocks one or two special perk choices at mid/high skill:
   * Farmer: better oxen handling, improved grass sense (less stock strain).
   * Banker: better prices when trading, small interest/credit events.
   * Carpenter: extra wagon repair efficiency, less part usage.
   * Teacher: morale-boosting camp events (stories, schooling) and improved doctoring outcomes.
   3. Skill-synergy events
   * Combine skills in checks: e.g. a difficult descent uses both Travel and Woodcutting (chaining wheels, braking), with special log text on success/failure.
F. Inventory & Economy Tweaks Along the Route
Existing goals (kept):
   * Realistic price inflation at forts; segment-specific trade goods; climate-tuned spoilage.
New detail from food & supplies + reference manual:
   1. Fort-specific price tables
   * Independence/St. Joseph: baseline Missouri prices from 1845 tables. 
   * Fort Kearny/Laramie: 2–3× price multipliers for flour, bacon, coffee, ammo.
   * Fort Hall/Boise: some items (flour, bacon, sugar, coffee) at 4–10× baseline.
   2. Goods that matter
   * Introduce small set of trade tags:
   * Warm blankets, coffee, sugar, tobacco, spare ammunition, bright cloth.
   * These can be traded with forts or Native groups for food or guidance events.
   3. Spoilage by climate & container
   * Raw meat and feast meals decay faster in hot, arid Snake/alkali segments; slower in high cool passes and Blue Mountain forests.
   * Optional: simple “barrel vs sack” distinction—bacon in bran or barrels decays slower than loose or repeatedly opened supplies, nodding to period practices. 
   4. Overload feedback
   * Better log messaging tying overload to real wagon capacities (16–2000 lb safe cargo, as in guidebooks) so players feel why 1,600–2,000 lb is the sweet spot.
G. Scene System & Temporal Viewport Mood
Existing goals (kept):
   * Use scene list mileage bands; weather/morale-aware mood selection; camp vs travel scenes. 
New art-direction hooks (Bierstadt / Remington / Maggiori):
   1. Mood palettes per region
   * Bierstadt-style luminous dawn/sunset for triumphant milestones (South Pass, Grande Ronde, Oregon City). 
   * Remington nocturnes (deep blue-green nights with firelight) for tense camp or guard events. 
   * Maggiori cinematic storm and cloud drama for pivotal route choices and storms, emphasizing tiny wagons under massive skies. 
   2. Scene tags
   * Each scene in the list gets tags like travel_day_clear, camp_evening_rain, night_guard, feast_event, illness_camp.
   * Viewport picker uses:
   * Region + miles.
   * Mode (camp vs travel).
   * Weather (clear/heat/storm/cold).
   * Party mood (mean morale, illness present, recent feast or tragedy).
   3. Event scenes
   * Pull from event art (river crossings, wagon crashes, illness, trade) as temporary viewport overlays when those events fire, then fade back to ambient travel scene.
H. Health & Illness Layer Anchored to Geography
Existing goals (kept):
   * Cholera/dysentery corridor; alkali poisoning; mountain fever/exposure; snakebite/breaks/frostbite/exhaustion; treatments via doctoring skill + supplies.
New specifics:
   1. Geography-aware risk tables
   * Platte in warm, wet periods: high cholera/dysentery risk if drinking from low holes or stagnant pools.
   * Alkali segments (Snake/40-mile desert): “alkali water” events with taste/morale penalties and condition hits unless water is diluted or avoided.
   * South Pass/Blues/Barlow: frostbite risk at night if warmth + clothing too low.
   2. Affliction progression
   * Each major illness has 3 stages (risk → onset → crisis/recovery) with clear log feedback and treatment hooks:
   * e.g. Dysentery: risk from bad water, onset with cramps & weakness, crisis with major dehydration and potential death if not treated with boiled water + rest.
   3. Doctoring gameplay
   * Doctoring skill influences:
   * Chance to correctly diagnose (log text clarity).
   * Effectiveness of treatments (fewer hours needed, less resource waste).
   * Fort doctors and missions can offer superior care for high price or with narrative consequences.
I. HTML5 Overlay, Audio & Fullscreen Hooks (Polish Phase)
Existing goals (kept):
   * Rain/lighting overlays, CRT/temporal viewport glow, HUD polish, soundscape with ambient loops & SFX, possible voice/TTS.
Expanded plan:
   1. Viewport overlay stack
   * Reuse arcade CRT/time-window treatments on scene and map (already partially in CSS).
   * Add:
   * Optional rain/snow canvas overlays when storms/snow events fire.
   * Occasional lightning flicker synced to storm log entries.
   2. Audio pass
   * Web Audio–based ambient loops:
   * Prairie wind, storms, river crossings, night campfire, fort bustle.
   * Audio sprites for UI clicks, task changes, event stingers to minimize requests. 
   3. Fullscreen support
   * Add a “Temporal Viewport Fullscreen” button that:
   * Uses the Fullscreen API on the Old Trail root container.
   * Respects mobile browser constraints (user gesture, iOS quirks) per fullscreen PDF guidance.
   4. Mobile-friendly tweaks
   * Make sure touch targets (buttons, dropdowns) are sized & spaced for phones.
    * Optionally auto-suggest fullscreen when user taps “Begin journey” on mobile for more immersive play, with an easy exit toggle.
    *
=== Weather & Start-Date System – TODO / FUTURE HOOKS ===
- Flesh out applyWeatherToParty(...) to translate storms, heat, mud, wind, and snow into travel speed, illness, and morale modifiers.
- Use recent precipitation history to influence river depth and bogging risk at fords and ferries.
- Tie hot/dry weather to dehydration, dust-related illness, and oxen fatigue events across the Platte and Snake River country.
- Tie cold/wet weather to hypothermia, pneumonia, and morale penalties in camp, especially in the Rockies and Blues.
- Add region-specific event variants keyed off weather (prairie fire, white-out blizzard, dust storm) and feed them into the viewport mood system.

Traillines Explorer – Phase 2+
- Replace placeholder wagon drawing with real wagon sprite (and oxen) with painterly style matching Remington/Bierstadt/Maggiori reference PDFs.
- Add distinct parallax background layers and biome-specific tiles for each region (plains, central plains, high plains, mountains, Snake plain, Blue Mountains, Columbia, Willamette).
- Implement walkable camp scenes on their own mini-maps (fire, wagons, foraging, water, wood) instead of menu-only decisions.
- Implement tactical mini-maps for raider attacks, rescues, and dangerous crossings (light squad-tactics feel, using existing delegation and hourly sim).
- Externalize trail geometry / world chunks into JSON data files that can be streamed and extended (supports cutoffs and alternate routes).
- Add mobile tilt/swipe integration for steering along the trail lane.
- Add companion sprites and simple formation logic on the explorer map (ties into delegation priorities and hourly tasks).
